            <main>
                <p>The story of Theseus and the Minotaur has many interpretations, however in the readings I have these differences aren’t necessarily so apparent. For instance, Apollodorus has a similar beginning to this story as many others. Theseus is to be one of the 14 youths to be sacrificed, “or as some affirm, he offered himself voluntarily” Apollod. Epit. p 133. The story further goes on to suggest that Theseus had agreed with his father to fly a white sail on the ship when returning, to signal to him that Theseus had survived. Apollodorus tells us Theseus forgot this sail, as he was in grief after Ariadne was carried off by Dionysus. This work whilst attributed to Apollodorus initially, has since been attributed to a Pseudo-Apollodorus. So whilst Apollodorus is said to have been writing in 180CE, Epit. has since been dated to approximately 001-200 CE. Either way, Greece was ruled by Rome during both periods of writing, but I find there is a distinct lack of Roman influence over this writing. The hero Theseus is still venerated for his skill at overcoming the beast in the Minotaur.<br>

                <br>
                If we contrast this with Cattul. We see a very heavy Roman influence on Theseus’ character. Whilst this poem does feature from Ariadne’s point of view, we see Theseus characterised as being forgetful, oath-breaking and faithless. This is shown in Cattul. 129-131 “Thus then, having bourne me afar from my father’s home, thus has thou left me, faithless, faithless Theseus, on the lonely shore? Thus departing, unmindful of the will of the gods, forgetful, ah!” Throughout his poem Cattul. Sheds Theseus in a light that is counter to that of Roman heroes of the time. Theseus is shown to do courageous things yes, but for himself rather than for the good of all, further exemplified by the fact that he also seemingly has no need for self-sacrifice. His suffering in this poem is brought down upon him by Jupiter at Ariadne’s request. This comes in the form of Jupiter causing Theseus to forget the sail due to adverse weather conditions on his trip home.<br>

                <figure class="float-right">
                    <img src="Labyrinth of the Minotaur.jpg" alt="Theseus and the Minotaur in a mosaic labyrinth" width="400" height="400">
                    <figcaption>Image 2: Theseus and the Minotaur fight in the centre of a mosaic labyrinth.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br>
                If we further compare the two, there are also some differences in how he retraced his steps out of the labyrinth, Cattul. Tells us that Theseus was able to retrace his steps by using “a thin clue of thread” Cattul. 109, whereas Apollodorus has Ariadne getting the secret of the Labyrinth from Daedalus the creator of the vast maze. Diod. Sic. provides a third alternative to the death of the Minotaur and subsequent escape. Diod. Sic. Tells us that Theseus and Aridane killed the Minotaur and escaped together, rather than Ariadne providing Theseus with an edge. Diod. Dic. P11. Ov. Met. Again sheds little light on how Theseus actually slays the Minotaur, however again says that he made his way out of the Labyrinth by following the thread. Ov. Met. 8.169-174. Image 1 further shows an alternative to the fight between the two. In the image Theseus is holding a sword, and physically grappling the Minotaur.<br>
                <br>
                Moving away from the myth momentarily, we can look at some of the potential history of this story. Mark tells us that there is potentially a real site in which this myth originates. He provides some speculation based of excavations conducted by Sir Arthur Evans 1894-1900, about “whether Minos was a name of an individual king or a title”. This followed from the discovery of King Minos’s palace Knossos, which had murals of bull jumping youths. This lead them to speculate that perhaps Knossos was the labyrinth from the myth. Archaeologists posited that perhaps this was the case, as many found themselves becoming lost whilst wondering the palace, often “finding oneself back in same room having come by a different route” (Mark, 2011). Further, they mention linking the worth labyrinth etymologically with labrys, which means double-axe. “The Double Axe Symbol was the sign of the Minoan goddess and found abundantly throughout Knossos” (Mark, 2011).<br>
                <br>
                <figure class="float-left">
                    <img src="Theseus & the Minotaur 3.jpg" alt="Theseus wrestles the Minotaur in the labyrinth" width="400" height="400">
                    <figcaption>Image 3: Theseus wrestles the bull-headed Minotaur in the heart of the labyrinth.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br>
                Images 2 and 3 are artists renditions of Theseus fighting the Minotaur in the heart of the labyrinth in mosaic form. Image 3 also shows other sacrificial youths watching on. Image 4 contains some additional signs of Theseus’ place as an Ancient Greek hero in that he appears to have the support of Athena, who stands by him with her helmet and spear. As can be seen, the physical material sources also provide a myriad of different depictions of how this story plays out.<br>
                <br>
                If we review the story of Theseus and the Minotaur from interpretations, we can see that many don’t really apply in the examples presented, for instance, there isn’t much from the perspective of Natural Allegory on the surface. There are no opposite elements, such as fire and water, easily identified in the story, and as such doesn’t hold much relevance. If we go by what Mark has posited, there is some chance that there is some Euhemerism involved from the archaeological finds, but these aren’t represented in the stories. That is there are no mentions of the two headed axe, and they clearly discuss a labyrinth, rather than a labrys.<br>
                <br>
                <figure class="float-right">
                    <img src="Theseus & the Minotaur 2.jpg" alt="Theseus and Athena after defeating the Minotaur" width="400" height="400">
                    <figcaption>Image 4: Theseus drags the dead Minotaur from the gates of the labyrinth, accompanied by Athena.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br>
                There is an argument that there are some aspects of moral allegory to the story, specifically when it comes to Theseus choosing to volunteer to be a sacrifice in an attempt to kill the Minotaur and end future sacrifices. Further, in Cattul. we see that Theseus is painted in a somewhat darker light, as he leaves her stranded on an island.<br>
                <br>
                I do believe that from the angle of romanticism there is quite a lot within this story, even if the romance ends somewhat in a tragedy for Ariadne. There is a somewhat romantic quality to Theseus’ choice to offer himself as a sacrifice, and then clearly there is an almost instant romance between Theseus and Ariadne, who forsakes her family to help him in his quest. As alluded to however, depending on the story this romance is not to last, whether it be Dionysus taking her as his wife, Artemis killing her, or Theseus abandoning her on an island with no way to return home, the romance is not one that is to last.</p>
